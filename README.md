# Greetr
This is a really basic 'library' that can be used as a greeter. This was completed as part of the Udemy course **JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts**

This library, while small, uses some of the methodologies and patterns that many popular libraries such as jQuery use. Feel free to clone and adapt or change however you wish.

## jQuery Free
The original version of Greetr, as completed in the Udemy course, utilized jQuery. While this Greetr library draws inspiration from jQuery patterns it does not rely on, or implement features of, jQuery and is completely stand-alone.
